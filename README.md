# Lab9jsfinal

Here is my lab 9. I created a website using html and javascript. It's a simple website but it shows how using javascript allows a website to be interactive via button presses. 
I've never worked with javascript and have only used html a couple times so I knew I'd have some tutorials to watch. This proved helpful and I was able to make this website.
